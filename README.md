## CDN link and scripts
The html files inculdes links from the Bootstrap CDN network. CDN stands for *Content Dilivery Network*.
This is a service, provided by Bootstrap, to host your source code. It uses a network of servers around the globe, to ensure delivery of scripts to end users,
depending on their location.
Use of a CDN is not required, but can be a helpfull tool.

##The backup folder
I have created a backup folder to store the historical changes to the site layout.
backup1_index.html is the file that has the code for the basic bootstrap layout.
All changes after will be stored in the follow up's to this file, a.i. backup2_index.html, backup3_index.html, etc. etc.
This will make it easy to track back the changes made to the code and see the site in phases.
In order to do this the files can be named back to index.html, to serve as a root file.

##Font family
The font family chosen for this project, *"Special Elite"* originates from fonts.google.com and emulates an ancient typewriter.
